This is an ACP Calculator.
It takes data in the form of a 2D matrix of numbers and outputs a new normalized matrix while keeping the essential columns of the matrix.

This project was originally a little Python script for a practical test in my DataScience engineering class (Exploratory Statistics Chapter).
It used to get its input from the command line or directly by assigning a random matrix from the NumPy library. So I thought why not make a GUI and automate this process (Maybe this will be useful some time later in my career, Hopium!)

The project is made with Tauri (Electron was a good option too, but it consumed so much memory for such a simple project.)

Btw, Rust is cool, but using it meant relying much more on AI in the Backend side.
